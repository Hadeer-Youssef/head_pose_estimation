# head_pose_estimation

The main objective of this task is to find the relative orientation (and position) of the human’s head with respect to the camera. In particular, in the head pose estimation task, it is common to predict relative orientation with Euler angles – yaw, pitch and roll. They define the object’s rotation in a 3D environment.
