# head_pose_estimation

"" Face Pose Estimation"" in This Project we need to

Predict angle Rotation "Eyer angle" (yaw ,pitch, roll)

analysis Data set is "AFLW2000" contain 2000 image every image has matlab file that contain numbers of keys like (pt3d_68 ,Pose_Para) to determine by using these keys angles and features in 2D

use this data to train model on all images in dataset and make predict right angle for any image

use more than library to determine which is better like (dlib,opencv,mediapipe)
